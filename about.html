          <p>I am Gibrán, from Mexico, a Mechatronics Engineer graduated from Tecnológico de Monterrey.
            I have worked for 10 years managing automation, maintenance, and production teams.</p>
          <p>
            What I enjoy most about automation is everything related to software, this is what motivated me to start a certification program by the MIT as a full-stack software developer to expand my knowledge and be ready for the challenges that may arise.</p>
          <p>
            Software is very interesting for me since it is constantly evolving and increasing presence in our environment, whether in advertising, sales, entertainment, or monitoring production processes, among others, as well as new areas of opportunity that are presented day by day
          </p>
          <p>I enjoy the fact of being able to transform an idea into a project, putting creativity, knowledge, and perseverance to the test, and showing myself that everything is possible.</p>
